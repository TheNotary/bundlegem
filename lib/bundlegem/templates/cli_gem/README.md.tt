If a CLI is being developed, see `exe/<%=config[:constant_name].downcase%>` and consider adopting Thor or its alternatives if this will be a heavy CLI tool.

For open source projects, releasing a new version is done with an update to the version number in `version.rb`.  Then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).  By default you'll need to tweak the gemspec file in root to enable pushes.
